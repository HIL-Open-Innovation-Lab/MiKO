Minimal Knowledge Objects (MIKOs) are self-contained, fundamental pieces of information designed to facilitate understanding, management, and application of health and medical knowledge. By organizing information into MIKOs, healthcare professionals can collaborate more effectively, make evidence-based decisions, and ensure the latest research findings are considered in clinical practice. In the context of diabetes, MIKOs can be divided into several knowledge artifacts, including ontological concepts, genomics, events, system layers of computing systems, communication layers, and care processes.

Ontological concepts:
These concepts provide a structured and standardized representation of medical knowledge, enabling efficient communication and understanding among healthcare professionals. For diabetes, ontological concepts can include disease classifications, diagnostic criteria, and associated complications.
Examples:

Type 1 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes
Gestational diabetes
Genomics:
Genomic information in MIKOs can help identify genetic predispositions, potential therapeutic targets, and pharmacogenomics for personalized treatment. In the context of diabetes, MIKOs can include details on relevant genes and genetic variations.
Examples:

HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes associated with Type 1 diabetes risk
TCF7L2 gene variant linked to Type 2 diabetes susceptibility
Pharmacogenomic information to optimize drug response, such as sulfonylureas and metformin
Events:
Events in MIKOs refer to significant occurrences in the disease process, such as diagnosis, monitoring, and management. In the case of diabetes, MIKOs can include clinical milestones and therapeutic interventions.
Examples:

Diabetes diagnosis based on blood glucose levels, HbA1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test
Regular monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profiles
Insulin administration, oral medications, and lifestyle interventions
System layers of computing systems:
These layers in MIKOs can cover various aspects of health information technology, such as electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms, and decision support systems. In diabetes care, MIKOs can include the integration of these technologies to enhance patient care.
Examples:

EHRs for tracking patient medical history, test results, and treatment plans
Telemedicine platforms for remote glucose monitoring and virtual consultations
Clinical decision support systems to provide personalized treatment recommendations
Communication layers:
Communication layers in MIKOs involve the effective exchange of information among healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders. In the context of diabetes, MIKOs can include communication strategies, guidelines, and tools.
Examples:

Interprofessional communication to coordinate care among primary care providers, endocrinologists, and other specialists
Patient education materials to promote self-management and lifestyle modifications
Guidelines for effective communication between healthcare professionals and patients
Care processes:
Care processes in MIKOs refer to the organization, delivery, and management of healthcare services. In the case of diabetes, MIKOs can involve the development of care pathways, quality improvement initiatives, and outcome measures.
Examples:

Diabetes care pathways outlining prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up
Quality improvement initiatives targeting HbA1c control, blood pressure management, and lipid management
Outcome measures such as glycemic control, diabetes-related complications, and patient satisfaction
By organizing health and medical knowledge into Minimal Knowledge Objects, healthcare professionals can access and apply information more effectively, improving patient outcomes and the overall quality of care.
